GROM was founded in 2012 with one goal in mind: Bringing 3D printing to the masses. With offices in San Francisco, Amsterdam and Hong Kong, GROM is truly international and highly ambitious.

GROM spent 2 years developing its first product group: 3D printed smartphone cases. Through a combination of 3D printing and mass manufacturing (Hybrid Production), GROM has harnessed the freedom of design and optimized its usability, quality and affordability.

Through the combination of state of the art product with easy to use customization software, any retailer is able to get access to the first affordable, customer oriented 3D printed product solution.
